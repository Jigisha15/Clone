This is a React App that is a clone of a random website made to focus more on my CSS skills and also as one of my tasks.
Stay tuned I'll be posting more of the code so that it is a great UI project.

This website is made using Reactjs and the jsx files are kept very basic that could be recepted by normal HTML users as well.

The CSS is not too complex.

The Routes are well organized.

If in case I ever delete the npm modules, make sure to use the following command to reinstall them using the command 'npm i node-modules'
